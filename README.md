## Project Description
This project aims to use Nodejs which is a back-end frameworks to fit a differential equation to the CHAT APPLICATION with users chat data. This would allow us to send our user message and our user also can able to receive our messages. This would be done separately per user as a sender or, as per user as a receiver. The results would be displayed on chat room.

Besides this, The project has implementation of an interesting use case of users current location history: a web application that is send location. The user can enter in the chat room then they can send there message and send location which would display sender's current location. An on the other hadn receiver can view the sender current location.
